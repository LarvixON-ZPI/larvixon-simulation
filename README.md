# Larvixon Simulation

A Unity project simulating larvae movement with realistic peristaltic motion.

## Overview

This simulation models larvae as 5-point segmented creatures that move using peristaltic waves (contractions and extensions) similar to real larvae. Each larva consists of:

- **Head**: The front segment (red)
- **2/5 Point**: First body segment  
- **Middle**: Center segment
- **4/5 Point**: Second body segment
- **Back**: Tail segment (blue)
